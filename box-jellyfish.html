          The Box Jellyfish (Cubozoa) is known to carry the most deadly venom in 
          the world. Their boxy like shape gives them its name with its tentacles
          growing up to 10 feet in length. They contain up to half a million micro
          needles in their tentacles.

          They mainly live in the Pacific and Indian oceans. Their lives are very 
          short, living an average lifespan of 3 months. Box Jellyfish are a little
          slow when it comes to speed, traveling an average speed of 4.6 mph.
