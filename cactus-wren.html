            <p>The cactus wren (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus) are 
                birds that settle within cactus plants, specifically 
                the saguaro and cholla in order to hide from predators. 
                They build their nests using materials from plants and 
                line them with their feathers. The cactus wren does not 
                migrate and stays in their home all year long. Their diet 
                usually consists of insects but they will sometimes eat 
                plants. Since they don't fly very well, they will scavenge 
                for food on the ground, lifting up rocks and eating 
                whatever lies beneath them.
