                Agalychnis callidryas are more commonly referred to as red eye tree frogs.
                 They are native to the forests of Central America and north-western South America. 
                 They inhabit lowland rainforests near water sources. These frogs are insectivores and can commonly be seen eating crickets, flies, and moths. 
                They are the smallest animal we have in this forest habitat zoo, with their lenght ranging from 2 to 3 inches.
