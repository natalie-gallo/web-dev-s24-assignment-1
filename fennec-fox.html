            <p>The fennec fox's (Vulpes zerda) most notable feature is its large ears, 
                used to listen to its surroundings and keep itself cool 
                from the heat. The fox has light-colored fur for two purposes: 
                keeping them warm during the night and reflecting sunlight 
                during the day. Fennec foxes are mainly nocturnals and dig 
                their dens into sand dunes. They are omnivores, eating many 
                foods such as leaves, fruits, lizards, and small rodents.
