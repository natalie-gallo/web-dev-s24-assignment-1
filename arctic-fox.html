            <p>The Arctic Fox (Vulpes lagopus) is a resilient and adaptive species 
                native to the Arctic tundra. Known for its iconic white fur that
                camouflages with the snowy landscape, the fox undergoes a seasonal
                color change, turning brown during the summer months. This small 
                carnivore is well-adapted to the harsh Arctic environment, with a 
                keen sense of hearing and a thick, insulating coat that helps it survive 
                in frigid temperatures. Arctic foxes are opportunistic hunters, scavenging 
                for small mammals and birds, and are known for their playful behavior, especially 
                during the breeding season.
