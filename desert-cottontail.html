            <p>The desert cottontail (Sylvilagus auduboni) is an herbivore 
                that mainly feeds on grass and is coprophagic, meaning they 
                consume their own feces. They are mainly active during the 
                evenings but are usually not seen hunting for food during 
                windy days as it can affect their hearing. Due to their size, 
                the cottontail has many predators, such as snakes and coyotes. 
                Its first course of action when spotting a predator is to 
                freeze in place. If being chased, they can hop away in a zig-zag 
                motion, with a speed of over 30km/h.
