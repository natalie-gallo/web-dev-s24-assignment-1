          The Carribean Reef Octopus (Octopus Briareus) lives in warm waters. This octopus
          can change its color and texture to blend into its environment! They are known to
          be one of the most intelligent inverebrates ever. They prey on crabs, shrimp, 
          and lobsters.

          They are preyed by sharks and stingrays. To protect themselves, they shoot ink
          from their bodies to hide themselves by using their ink clouds as cover. A female
          octopus can lay up to 500 eggs! With the eggs taking at least 50 days to hatch.
