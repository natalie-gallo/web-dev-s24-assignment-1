            <p>The Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) is a massive marine
                mammal thriving in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. Recognizable by its 
                long tusks and distinctive whiskers, the walrus is well-adapted for life 
                in both icy waters and on sea ice. These social creatures are often found 
                in large herds, and they rely on a diet of benthic invertebrates, using 
                their sensitive whiskers to locate prey on the ocean floor. Walruses are 
                known for their impressive haul-out sites, where they rest, socialize, and 
                give birth. Climate change and diminishing sea ice pose challenges to their 
                habitat and survival.
