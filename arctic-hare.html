            <p>The Arctic Hare (Lepus arcticus) is a hardy herbivore inhabiting 
                the Arctic tundra and other cold regions. Renowned for its white coat in winter, the 
                hare molts to a gray or brown hue during the summer, providing effective camouflage 
                against predators. Large hind legs enable swift movement across the snow-covered terrain, 
                and its well-insulated fur provides protection against the extreme cold. Arctic hares are primarily 
                herbivores, consuming a variety of plant materials, and they employ keen senses to detect predators 
                in the vast and open Arctic landscape.
