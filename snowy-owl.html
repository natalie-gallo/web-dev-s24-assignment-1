            <p>The Snowy Owl (Bubo scandiacus) is an iconic bird 
                of prey inhabiting the Arctic tundra and surrounding regions. Recognized 
                for its striking white plumage, the snowy owl is superbly adapted to its 
                snowy surroundings. With keen eyesight and exceptional hunting skills, it 
                preys on lemmings and other small mammals. Unlike many owl species, snowy 
                owls are diurnal, active during both day and night. Their large size and 
                distinctive appearance make them a symbol of the Arctic ecosystem, and they 
                undertake impressive long-distance migrations in search of prey and suitable 
                nesting sites.
