            <p>The kangaroo rat (Dipodomys) gets their name from the way 
                they hop similar to regular kangaroos. Their fur-lined 
                cheek pouches allow them to store food. Kangaroo rats' diet 
                mostly consists of seeds but will also extend to insects or 
                vegetation. In addition, they are locomotives, meaning they 
                only use their hind legs to hop from 7-9 feet, reaching 
                speeds up to 10km/h.
